There's a couple things you have to do to make this work.

First, and probably most important....
To change the URL of the link when someone clicks "skip intro" or
"enter here" or the URL redirection kicks in, simply open the text file
which was included in your download and look for this:

&url=http://www.wyomingwebdesign.com/index.html

and change it so that it points to the page you want to open. Do NOT
confuse this with:

&varURL=

which is used to specify text only and will NOT change the link. (This is not
found on all intros - only a few)

You're simply changing the direction the flash goes when it finishes. You're
switching it from my domain and my page, to your domain and your page.

The text file can be edited with any text editor. It needs to be located
in the SAME directory as the flash (.swf file). In the text file you'll see
something like this - "text1=Variable Text 1". Leave the "text1=" part
alone. Change only the text AFTER that. There are size limitations. If
you change it to "My Wonderful Home Page That I've Been Working
On For Years" and when you run the Flash all you see is, "My
Wondeful Home Page Tha" it means you've put too much text in.

If your variable text is too far to the left, you can center in simply by adding 
white space....

text1=Variable Text 1

  becomes:

text1=           Variable Text 1

The flash file itself (the .swf file) needs to be in the same folder as the
.html and .txt files. Just upload everything to your main/root directory.
It may be called "htdocs" or "public_html" or something like that. It
may not be named at all.

This all may sound complicated but it's really not. 3 things you have to do:

1. Insert your own text in the variable text file - &text1=  etc...
2. Change the button URLs in the variable text file - &url=   etc...
3. Upload all files to the same directory/folder.

The "Wyoming Webdesign" link will be removed for $5.00 (US). We often 
make exceptions. If your site is religious in nature (any religion, any faith, any
denomination) and non-profit, we will remove the link for you. Email me
your site address and the name of the intro you're using and I'll get a new file
to you probably the same day. If your site shows up on a search engine (any
search engine using any keywords) I will remove the link PROVIDED you place
a link back to me on some other page of your site. I don't care where it's at as
long as it's a page that is linked to your other pages. Everyone else - $ 5.00.
Place the link FIRST and then send us the URL where it is located at.

WE DO NOT provide link free versions free of charge to start up sites, sites
under construction or sites hosted on free servers. Please don't ask.

Versions without our link can be purchased here:

We STRONGLY advise anyone wishing to purchase a linkfree version to first 
download a linked version and do a test install on their server just to make sure
you won't have any problems later on

If you have any questions NOT covered in this readme file, let me know and
I'll be happy to answer them. If your question is answered here in these
instructions, it's doubtful you'll get a response at all. Don't let this put you
off from writing and asking for help. If you've made an honest effort to follow
the instructions and things still aren't working, we'll help you. Make the effort
first though.

After opening the HTML file in frontpage you'll need to save it again without
letting frontpage change any of the code, which it is notorious for doing.

go to "Tools", 
click "Page Options", 
click "Format Using the Rules Below".  
ensure that setting is "Preserve existing HTML".
Save the file

You can not sell this intro, and this includes installing it on any website as 
part of any web design package that you make money from - people have.

The entire package of flash intros can be purchased outright. If you purchase 
them, the link is removed and html formatting is enabled for the variable text.
You're also allowed to do just about whatever you want to with them, including
sell them if you can, or use them in commercial webdesign projects. 
You can not only change the variable text, you can change the font, the font size 
and the font color. There's a much greater degree of flexibility in the amount of 
customization you can put in each. If you're interested, contact me for details at 
info -at- kwebmedia.com. Include a SPECIFIC subject line. We get a HUGE 
amount of email from quite a few different websites all funneled into one account
so make sure your email catches someone's eye or it'll probably won't get read.
