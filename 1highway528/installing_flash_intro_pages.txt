Upload ALL files to your main/root directory.

For the Flash intro to be your default start page, simply rename your existing 
start page. Typically speaking, start pages are called "index.html", "index.htm", 
"default.html", or "default.htm". Your home/start page "probably" has one of 
these file names. You're going to have to rename it. This can be accomplished 
simply by opening your start page and then resaving it under a different file 
name. Typically people use "index2.html", although your choice of actual file 
name is irrelevant. Once you save your start page under the new file name, you 
will now have 2 copies of the same page, each with different file names. 

             //////////////// Follow these steps ////////////////////////

Assuming your start page is called index.html...

Open index.html. 

Locate the "save as" feature of whatever editor you're using and manually enter the 
filename "index2.html" (or whatever your preference is). 

Click "save as".  

Open the flash HTML file (it was included in the download and will have the same
name as the intro you've selected, although with .html as an extension and the number
"1" in front of it. If you've downloaded the green_bars intro, the flash HTML will be
called "1green_bars.html").

Using "save as", save the flash HTML file as index.html.

                   //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

What you've done is merely swap file names. The flash intro has become your start 
page and your original start page has been renamed to index2.html. 

Additionally, you'll need to edit your other pages. Any "HOME" links which currently 
point to index.html will need to be edited to point to index2.html (unless you want 
visitors to your site to view your intro over and over again).

The flash intro is not your true home page. It is essentially a gateway that leads your
visitors TO your home page. We need to style it "as" your home page though in order
for it to be the first page served when people arrive at your site.

We do provide a customization service for our free intros for a small fee. Typically, this
service involves expanding the intro to allow more text, adding music or other audio
files, adding effects and preloading stages, etc... and of course our link is also removed.
